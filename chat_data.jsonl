The Patents Act of 1970, which came into force in 1972, is the primary legislation governing patents in India. The Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks (CGPDTM), based in Mumbai, oversees the Act's administration. The Patent Office, headquartered in Calcutta, has branches in Delhi, Chennai, and Mumbai. Amendments to the Patents Act have been made in 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2006 to make it compliant with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. The most significant amendment came in 2005, which extended product patent protection to sectors such as food, drugs, and chemicals. This allowed product patents to be granted for a 20-year term. The amendment also introduced provisions for granting compulsory licenses for exporting medicines to countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity, in line with the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. Notably, Section 3(d) was introduced to address patentability criteria. The 2005 amendment faced criticism for potentially increasing product prices, particularly essential medicines. However, the government has taken steps, including compulsory licensing, to ensure affordable drug prices. The amendment also aimed to boost the Indian pharmaceutical industry's competitiveness. Despite initial concerns, Indian generic drug manufacturers have thrived, and multinational corporations have established research and development centers in the country, highlighting the positive impact of the amended patent regime. The Patents Act and its amendments have played a crucial role in aligning India's intellectual property framework with global standards while ensuring a balance between innovation, public health, and industry growth."}]}

However, a layout design exploited for less than two years may be registered. A design is considered original if it results from the creator's intellectual efforts and is not widely known at the time of creation. *Withdrawal of Acceptance**: The Registrar can withdraw acceptance if it is found that the layout design is ineligible for registration, but the applicant may be given a chance to be heard before this decision. **Advertisement of Application**: Accepted applications must be advertised within 14 days. If corrections or amendments occur, the Registrar may advertise again. **Opposition to Registration**: Any person may oppose a registration application within three months of advertisement. The applicant can counter the opposition within two months, or their application may be deemed abandoned. Evidence may be submitted by both parties, and security for costs may be required if neither resides in India. The Registrar will make a decision based on the provided materials. **Registration**: If an application is not opposed or if opposition favors the applicant, the Registrar will register the layout design and issue a certificate. Registration grants exclusive rights for 10 years, allowing the creator to commercially exploit the design and seek legal relief in cases of infringement. The Registrar has the authority of a civil court to gather evidence and resolve disputes, which can also be referred to an Appellate Board."}]}

The formulation of this act has come up with the establishment of the Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), a government body that is responsible for issuing and maintaining the security of digital signatures as well as certificates. The Act has made it mandatory for companies to obtain consent from consumers when it comes to collecting or using their personal information. With the Act becoming effective, individuals have the right to seek compensation in case of damage or misuse of their personal data by an unauthorised party. Through the Act, the Government of India can criminalise cybercrime, hacking and spreading of computer viruses.

When it comes to the cost of getting a patent, the following two elements come into the picture:  \n  \nGovernment fees for forms and renewals, If you choose to have an agent, then the charges for the professional It is always recommended to get a patent through a registered agent.  \nHere is the procedure on how to apply for patent in India:  \nSTEP 1: Invention Disclosure  \nThe first step is to disclose your invention to the professional. This is done by signing a non-disclosure agreement.   \nIt is recommended to submit each known fact about your invention. Do not hold anything back.  \nSTEP 2: Patentability Search  \nUsually, a professional charges a fee (approximately INR 10,000 to INR 20,000) at this step. At this stage, your professional performs extensive research for prior evidence in all the possible databases. Further, he or she builds a patentability search report based on your invention.   \nSTEP 3: Filing an Application for a Patent  \nThis is where the actual process begins. After detailed research about (any) existing history of your invention, you can decide if you want to go ahead with the patent application filing.   \nYour invention must have an 'inventive step' as compared with existing prior art pieces to qualify for a patent. It must have either 'technical advanced' or 'economically significant' or both over any existing piece of art.   \nThe step where you decide to go ahead with the filing process by writing an application is called patent drafting.  \nSTEP 4: Patent Drafting  \nThis is the fourth step in how to get a patent in India. For this, you can choose to draft the application on your own or take a professional's help to do this. If you choose to get help, you might have to pay somewhere between INR 20,000 to INR 30,000.   \nThis is one of the most crucial steps of the entire process. It requires both technical and legal understanding. If not drafted the right way, all the effort you put in gets wasted. Hence it's a good idea to take professional help here.   \nSTEP 5: Filing the Patent Application  \nIt is one of the steps on how to file a patent application in India. After you are done reviewing your patent draft and are satisfied with the scope and details, you are ready to file for a patent.   \nYou can file the patent application in a prescribed manner with appropriate forms with fees. You need to pay fees of INR 1,600 4,000 or 8,000 (based on the type of application) while submitting the patent application to the patent office. If you do not file a request for early publication, the patent application will be published on expiry of 18 months.  \nSTEP 6: Request for Examination  \nThis is the step where the applicant is required to request the Indian patent office to examine your patent application within 48 hours. Requests for examination fees range from INR 4,000 to INR 20,000 (based on the type of applicant).  \nSTEP 7: Responding to Objections (if any)  \nThe draft and the report submitted to the officers in the patent office are thoroughly examined at this step. At this step, there is a chance for the inventor to communicate his novelty or inventive step over any other piece of art found during the assessment. If all the things are well clarified and solved, the patent application is almost ready to come to action.   \nSTEP 8: Grant of Patent  \nIf the application meets all the prescribed requirements, it is placed in order for the grant. Usually, the final grant of the application is notified through a journal that is published.  \nSTEP 9: Renewal of Your Patent  \nOne of the last steps on how to obtain a patent in India is the renewal of your patent. Usually, a patent is in force for 20 years. On completion of 20 years, the owner is required to renew the patent by paying a small fee.  \nThese were some important steps to be followed on how to apply for a patent in India."}]}

Make sure all individuals who significantly contributed to creating innovation are recognised as inventors in the declaration.  \n5. Authorisation for Representation  \nThe representation authorization allows an agent or attorney to represent the applicant in patent-related issues.
