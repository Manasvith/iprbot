# LLM-Powered Chatbot

This project involves developing a chatbot powered by OpenAI's "GPT-40" model, with custom fine-tuning to improve its ability to generate message-formatted responses based on credible internet sources. The interface is built using Streamlit, and the backend is powered by Supabase, a relational cloud database. The application also integrates speech recognition and output functionalities, making it accessible and interactive. Additionally, the chatbot supports translation of responses to Indian languages using AWS Translate Service. The entire application is deployed on the Streamlit Cloud Platform.

## Features
- **LLM-Powered Chatbot**: Built on OpenAI's GPT-40 model and fine-tuned with message-formatted responses sourced from credible internet information.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for seamless interaction with the chatbot.
- **Speech Input & Output**: Speech input is captured through Streamlitâ€™s audio recorder, and speech output is provided using the Google Text-To-Speech module.
- **Translation Support**: Responses can be translated into Indian languages using AWS Translate Service.
- **Database Integration**: Powered by Supabase for storing relevant data and project information.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Streamlit Cloud Platform for easy access and scalability.
